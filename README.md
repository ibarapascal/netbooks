## 1. How to run this  

1.1. Serve pages  [http://localhost:3000/books](http://localhost:3000/books)

```shell
npm install
yarn install
yarn start
```

1.2. File dependencies visualization by `arkit`  

```shell
yarn arkit src/ -o src/temp/vision-all-files.svg
yarn arkit src/ -o src/temp/vision-view-components.svg -e "src/reducer.tsx,src/store.tsx,src/types/BaseTypes.tsx,src/types/LocalStorage.tsx"
```

1.3. File history visualization by `gource`  

```shell
gource --seconds-per-day 10 -1920x1080 --auto-skip-seconds 0.5
```

1.4. Documents auto generated by `styleguidist`  [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060)

```shell
yarn document
```

## 2. What this is doing  

2.1 Demand  

Create a simple Bookstore web app: [data source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bvaughn/infinite-list-reflow-examples/master/books.json)  

- The user should be able to see a list of books titles  
- The user should be able to select and see the detail of the book.  

2.2 Functions  

- Filter display data via multiple attributes, using multiple option to match.  
- Reactive tags to select / show display data.  
- Showing data in multiple ways with responsive components.  
- OnMouseOver, click, debounce and other user evnets binding.  
- SPA with router, left preparation for furthur implements (validation, cache, common components, etc).  
- Single source constant definition, type check for almost all attributes.  
- Automatic generated document / file structure analysis.

## 4. Dev notes  

### Ways to bind styles in react classic / functional components  

1. For normal DOM element, we can import classic `.css` file.  

2. For Material-UI element in classic components, we can use `withStyle` HOC, but facing problems with `styleguidist`, we made some approach to let it became possible.  

3. For Materia-UI element in functional components, simply use `useStyles` hooks via react latest feature.  

### Data completeness  

By type check with static data given by the link above.  

Attributes below are given as optional.  

```tsx
isbn?: string;
publishedDate?: PublishedDate;
thumbnailUrl?: string;
shortDescription?: string;
longDescription?: string;
```

Since we want to use `isbn` as the unique index, we decide not to display the data which does not have `isbn` number.  

Addition: isbn also duplicated, remove them till the only one left.  

### Debounce rendering react component

Refer to react-debounce-render [repo](https://github.com/podefr/react-debounce-render)

Currently they do not have typescript support refer to this [issue](https://github.com/podefr/react-debounce-render/issues/14)  

Plan to published a typescript version of it later.  

### Performance

During shift between `Card` and `List`, thumbnails requested multiple times.  

Can be solved by hide rather than re-rendering.  

As for large set of picture, we can use page to seperate, and use front-end local cache to make optimization.  

### Responsive

Material-UI layout `Grid` and so on act as responsive.  

Notice styles adjustment may also need to match those approach.
